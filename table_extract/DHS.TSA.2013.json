Include an explanation of any dependencies between this investment and other investments. [LIMIT: 2500 char] 1. The Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) was established to meet the congressional mandate for 100% screening of aviation-checked baggage in the National Airspace System for explosives by electronic or other approved means. This mandate was established in the 2001 Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71). By utilizing screening activities that minimize the risk of personal injury or death, or damage or loss of property due to acts of terrorism or criminal activity directed at aviation transportation, the program directly supports the Transportation Security Administration?s (TSA) goals of protecting the transportation system from dangerous people and items that threaten its security, managing risks to critical transportation infrastructure, and strengthening the TSA?s operations and management. The EBSP program ensures freedom of movement for people and commerce. This benefit to the TSA mission is achieved through a risk-based prioritized requirements methodology, and through development, testing, procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of checked baggage Transportation Security Equipment (TSE) screening technologies. Key objectives of the program include: increasing threat detection capability, improving screening efficiency, replacing the aging fleet of Explosives Detection Systems (EDS) and Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) units, utilizing competitive procurement contracts to obtain the best value for the government, and international harmonization of screening methodologies. The primary beneficiaries of the EBSP are the traveling public; the TSA Office of Security Operations, whose staff manages the daily operations of deployed TSE; commercial airlines; and airport authorities. EBSP is currently dependent on the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate?s Transportation Security Laboratory for certification of the screening equipment and research and development of emerging screening technologies. The TSA Security Technology Integrated Program (STIP) is being executed to enable remote maintenance and monitoring of the deployed screening equipment, as well as enabling a dynamic risk-based security capability through remote upgrades and toggling of threat detection algorithms. How does this investment close in part or in whole any identified performance gap in support of the mission delivery and management support areas? Include an assessment of the program impact if this investment isn't fully funded. [LIMIT: 2500 char] 2. Mission: The Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) provides technology to enable prevention of catastrophic loss from terrorist or criminal activity through screening passenger checked baggage for concealed explosives. EBSP achieves this mission by managing the full life cycle of acquisition activities including requirements identification, testing, procurement, deployment, and sustainment of screening equipment. EBSP enables TSA to prevent catastrophic loss and air piracy through screening checked baggage while ensuring freedom of movement for people and commerce. Though EBSP covers all modes of transportation, including aviation, maritime, and land, current deployed technology primarily covers aviation security. EBSP implements a national checked-baggage screening system that is designed to oversee the technology that screens passenger checked baggage to deter, detect, mitigate and prevent the transportation of explosives. The technologies protect the transportation system and its passengers, allowing more freedom of movement of people and commerce by mitigating risks and averting terrorist violence and other threats to persons and physical assets. LCCE estimates of required funding currently exceed the budgeted funding levels. The impact of not being fully funded includes the delay in completing the deployment of EDS, the delay in recapitalizing deployed EDS that have reached the end of their projected useful life with the potential for increasing maintenance costs and the risk reaching a state of technological obsolescence, and the inability to"]], [[0, 0, 5, 1, 2, "respond efficiently and effectively to emerging threats across all the approximately 450 Federalized airports in the National Airspace System. A broader impact to TSA of EBSP not being fully funded is the inability to implement its vision of layered security. Although EBSP receives its own appropriations and funding based on its annual acquisition needs, multiple compatible and interoperable systems deployed within the airport environment provide an effective layered security approach. When combined with other TSA programs such as Passenger Screening Program (PSP) and Security Technology Integrated Program (STIP), EBSP becomes part of the TSA vision of layered security. 3.

Is this investment consistent with a life cycle model defined in OMB Circular A-131(i.e., an initial period of development followed by a period of primarily operational spending and an identifiable end point): 2.a. No Describe why the investment is not consistent with life cycle model management defined in OMB Circular A-131, and explain how you adapted your alternatives analysis for this investment? (Where an agency uses a cost model other than the lifecycle cost model, defined by OMB Circular A-131, responses from 2c to 2h below should reflect the alternative concept.) [LIMIT: 1000 char] (Required if 2.a. is N): 2.b. EBSP is a mixed life cycle program that must sustain a steady state requirement to perform 100 percent screening of checked baggage, and at the same time, continuously upgrade its threat detection capability to respond to emerging threats without a future end point. Ideally, the DME upgrade component can be incorporated in technology refresh (ie., \"recapitalization\") that must be undertaken to meet maintenance cost objectives, avoid technological obsolescence, and ensure that EBSP can continue to meet its 100 percent screening requirement. The Alternatives Analysis was adapted to the fact that the investments in new technologies occur over time by specifically identifying those future investments and quantifying them to a present value for purposes of nPV and ROI calculations of the investment. Provide information on what cost model this investment is using and how costs are captured for what years [LIMIT: 1000 char] (Required if 2.a. is N): 2.c. EBSP uses the Integrated Deployment Model that models the performance and costs of the checked baggage inspection systems deployed across the approximately 450 airports in the National Airspace System. It is a top-down cost estimation system that uses a program-wide WBS. What year did this investment start (use year\u2014i.e., PY-1=2010) (Required if 2.a. is Y): 2.d. What year will this investment end (use year\u2014i.e., BY+5=2018) (Required if 2.a. is Y): 2.e.

As a general approach, TSA acquisitions, in accordance with DHS EVM Guidance (November 2006), will apply EVM to cost or incentive contracts which exceed twenty million dollars ($20M). Application of the EVM approach is normally discouraged for Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts due to the added expense of administering EVM in accordance with ANSI/EIA 748 and additionally FFP contracts are structured for the contractor to bear the risk of cost and schedule variance thus mitigating some benefit of applying the ANSI/EIA 748. For hardware and maintenance acquisitions EBSP makes extensive use of FFP contracts. A FFP contract reduces the impact of not using an ANSI compliant EVM system. The resources required for administering and reporting on EVM related data often negate the benefits of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. When applicable, EBSP will seek to utilize EVM on tasking related to deployment activities in accordance with DHS Earned Value Management Guidance (Nov. 06), TSA Management Directive MD 300.11, and OMB Circular A-11. A significant portion of the EBSP resources are expended through acquiring and maintaining security equipment and cost sharing arrangements with airports to install systems. The EBSP acquisition strategy and approach for equipment purchase and maintenance support is impacted, in part, by the small number of manufacturing / maintenance firms that comprise the checked bag security equipment industrial base. EBSP uses IDIQ contract vehicles for the purchase and install of screening equipment; once quantities are definitized, these contracts become FFP based on fixed unit prices for the equipment. An organic maintenance staff and infrastructure does not exist thus requiring many items to be repaired by the original equipment manufacturer. Due to proprietary data, maintenance contracts are often non-competitive but performance based FFP contracts.

Activities and Technology Specific: Provide a minimum of three \u2013metrics which measure the investment against its defined process standards or technical service level agreements (SLAs) (e.g.; \u201cReliability and Availability\u201d). At least one of these metrics must have a monthly \u201cReporting Frequency.\u201d Provide results specific metrics which are appropriate to the mission of the investment and its business owner or Customer. Generally these metrics should be provided by the investment\u2019s business owner and will reflect performance in the broader business activities and not IT-specific functions. The best results specific metrics will support the business case justification and could be the foundation of a quantitative approach to defining benefits in a cost-benefit analysis. Unlike in private industry where identified benefits accrue to the organization, government benefits may accrue to the public. Therefore, results- specific metrics may demonstrate the value realized external to the Federal Government.

In this field, describe the units used, any calculation algorithm used, and the definition or limits of the population or \u201cuniverse\u201d measured. The unit of measure should be characterized (e.g. number, percentage, dollar value etc) for each metric. If the unit is not on the drop down list, please choose \u201cOther\u201d and provide unit of measure description in the \u201cMetric Description\u201d field. Each metric listed in the table must also indicate how often actual measurements will be reported (monthly, quarterly or semi-annually), as well as baseline, targets and actual results.
